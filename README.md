# PulseSequenceOptimization

Code supporting the paper: Genetic algorithm-based optimization of pulse sequences, MRM 2021

The folders contain the main scripts and the cost functions to design pulses presented in the paper as well as some other tools

Please be cautios about bugs. Also bear in mind that I was a complete rookie when I coded most parts and, unlike general convention, for example the protons
are the S spins and X-nuc are the I spins.
